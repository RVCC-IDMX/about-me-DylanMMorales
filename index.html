        <p>Introduction:Since I feel like this is fitting for this class I did more research In the world of web design, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) serves as a powerful tool for enhancing the visual appeal websites (If done correctly). One of the lesser-known yet cool features of CSS is clipping and masking. These techniques allow designers to manipulate the shape and visibility of elements on a webpage, opening up a world of creative possibilities.</p>
            <p>Understanding CSS Clipping and Masking:CSS clipping and masking are techniques used to control the visibility of elements on a webpage by defining specific areas where content should be shown or hidden. While both techniques serve similar purposes, they differ in their approach:</p>
            <p>Clipping: CSS clipping involves restricting the visible area of an element based on a defined shape or path. This can be achieved using various properties such as clip-path and overflow. By specifying a shape, designers can create visually interesting effects such as rounded corners, custom shapes, or even complex patterns.</p>
            <p>Masking: CSS masking, on the other hand, involves applying an image or gradient as a mask to selectively show or hide parts of an element. This is commonly used for creating effects like fades, gradients, or revealing portions of an image. The mask property along with its various functions such as mask-image and mask-mode are used to implement masking effects.(making this circle took me 2 hours to learn)</p>
