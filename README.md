About Me - Dylan Morales
Netlify Status Success

Description
"About Me" is my project to understand coding better by seeing it visually. I've found that traditional learning methods often lack the hands-on experience needed to truly grasp complex concepts. Instead of just reading about it, I'm turning code into pictures to learn how it works. Each part of the project teaches me something new about coding, from making web pages to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a dynamic environment.

This project is like my own playground for coding. I can try out different things and see what happens, which helps me learn faster. The colors I've used not only look nice but also help me remember important coding stuff. Each section of the project represents a milestone in my coding education, offering valuable insights and practical skills along the way. With "About Me," I'm taking small steps to learn coding by actually building things. Each part of the project teaches me something new, from making web pages look good on different devices to adding cool interactive features.

Through colorful visuals and simple explanations, "About Me" makes coding less intimidating and more fun. It's like painting with code.

Skills Learned:
HTML & CSS: Mastering the fundamentals of web development.
